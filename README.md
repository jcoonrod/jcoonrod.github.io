## FreeCell based on SVG and Emoticons

This is a PWA version of Freecell, rewritten from a web version I wrote in 2001 and now rewritten consistent with what I hope are best practices in the 2019 web. 

The goal is to have a super-simple, super-light version.

I've written a Medium article going into some details of this at https://medium.com/@John.Coonrod/plain-vanilla-playing-cards-in-on-the-modern-web-18451cb54b5e

There are extra files in this repository not in the manifest - namely the svg files that I convert to png icons.

MANY thanks to jamesjohnson280 for his Medium Article "Hello World" which is an excellent tutorial on writing a PWA. I've tried other tutorials, but his actually worked for me.

ADDITIONAL thanks to kosamari for solving the problem of updating PWAs hosted on github: https://gist.github.com/kosamari/7c5d1e8449b2fbc97d372675f16b566e

The icon is based on the open source twemoji file for the crown emoji

## 2024 Update: v1.6 - prevent translation and search popups.
