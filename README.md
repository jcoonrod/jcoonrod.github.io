## Frecell based on SVG and Emoticons

This is a PWA version of Freecell, rewritten from a web version I wrote in 2001 and now rewritten consistent with what I hope are best practices in the 2019 web. 

The goal is to have a super-simple, super-light version.

MANY thanks to jamesjohnson280 for his Medium Article and his hello-pwa excellent tutorial on writing a PWA. I've tried other tutorials, but his actually worked for me.
