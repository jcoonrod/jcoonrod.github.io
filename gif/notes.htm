Programming notes

How many cards can move from column a to column b?

If there are no open columns and n free cells, then you can move n+1;
If there is one open column, you can first move n+1 cards to the open
column and then n+1 more over to the new location.

So: for m free columns and n free cells, you can move a line up to
(m+1)*(n+1) cards long.

This gets checked in fmove.
